## Ideas for further development
- Connect the application with the chessboard using a wireless network. Interaction will be based on the pub-sub model (See socketio module)
- A 2 axis linear guide setup using stepper motors to move chess pieces using an electromagnet
- RFID based chess piece identification (Scanning using an array of 8 RFID readers mounted on a linear guide)
